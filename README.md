# License Plate Recognition System

Developed a License Plate Recognition System which performs plate detection, character segmentation and character recognition to identify the Licence Plate Number. Used Open CV and Heuristics for plate detection, and Pytesseract and linear SVM for character recognition. Refer to - Documentation(https://github.com/ashutoshsuman99/License-Plate-Recognition-System/blob/master/Documentation.pdf) for more information.
